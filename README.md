# total

The `total` library lets you exhaustively pattern match on types using
`Traversal`s, `Prism`s, and `Lens`es.

# Quick Start

* Install the [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/)
* `cabal install total`

Example code:

```haskell
import Lens.Family.Total
import Lens.Family.Stock

total :: Either Char Int -> String       -- Same as:
total = _case                            -- total = \case
    & on _Left  (\c -> replicate 3  c )  --     Left  c -> replicate 3 c
    & on _Right (\n -> replicate n '!')  --     Right n -> replicate n '!'
```

# Development Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriella439/Haskell-Total-Library.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Gabriella439/Haskell-Total-Library)

I don't foresee any additions to the library, so it's probably stable.  Only
time will tell.
